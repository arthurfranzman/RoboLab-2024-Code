# RoboLab-2024-Code
Our Code in the summer semester 2024 internship. 

## Goal of the internship
The internship contained controlling a robot to fully explore a so-called planet or, if given, move to a specified target. 
My team consisted of two people, but i wrote most of the code. Everything is 100% python.
